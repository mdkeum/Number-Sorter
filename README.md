# Number-Sorter
The Number Sorter is a basic algorithmic project that allows users to sort an array of numbers in ascending order. Built as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum, this project focuses on fundamental algorithmic thinking, particularly sorting algorithms, and the implementation of efficient code to achieve the desired outcome.
